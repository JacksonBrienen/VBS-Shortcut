# VBS-Shortcut
The Simplest, that I have found, way to make a Shortcut in java, using built in windows tools like CMD and VBS.<br>
<h2>Why I Made This</h2>
I've seen many good implementations Like JShortcut, by Jim McBeath, found at: https://github.com/jimmc/jshortcut<br>
and expanding of JShortcut with mslinks by Dmitii Shamrikov, found at: https://github.com/BlackOverlord666/mslinks<br>
For what I was needing at the time, while these implementations were great, I felt as If they were a bit over complicated for the simplicity that I needed.<br>
This led me to create VBS-Shortcut, as the name states creating Shortcuts with VBS. This approach is minimal, and will not be as built out as the ones named above. But for a simple, easy to understand, Windows shortcut creator for java, I feel this will suffice.<br>
<h2>Important Notes</h2>
The code you see is working on Windows 10 as of 2021, while it is anticipated to work with previous versions of windows, it cannot be expected to do so.<br>
The Java Runtime Environment(JRE) used was 1.8.0_281<br>
